    "title": "“Que cosa es ser negra?”: Afro-Peruvian Women’s Narratives in Black Documentaries ",
    "description": "This research centers on the ways Afro-Peruvian women narrate their lives, identities, and histories in Black documentaries from Peru. Drawing from Black feminist theory, this research project understands Afro-Peruvian women as knowledge producers who articulate their meanings through their lived experiences and memories. I approach documentary films as audiovisual archives in which Afro-Peruvian women's lives are mediated, narrated, and sometimes erased by Peru's gender and racial politics. ",
